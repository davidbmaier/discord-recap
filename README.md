# Discord Recap

A tool to explore your Discord data package.

Going live: soon ðŸ‘€

## What can this do?

The web app scans through your Discord data package and extrapolates a ton of information about:

- your account
- your servers
- your channels
- your DMs
- your messages
- your activity

and a bunch more!

Everything happens in the browser, and no external requests are made (apart from fetching some Discord emoji).

### Feature requests

The web app tries to capture as many stats as possible - if you have any ideas for new features, please open an issue.

## Setup

The web app uses [Remix](https://remix.run) and [React](https://reactjs.org).
To get started, simply install the dependencies (`npm i`) and run the server (`npm run dev`).
